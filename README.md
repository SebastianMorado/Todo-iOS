# Todo-iOS

## What is it?

This app is a sleek alternative to other reminder/list apps. Todo-iOS provides the essential functionality of a To-do list app that most users look for and it presents it in an intuitive way. The apps current layout allows it to be easily extended much further with features if needed.

## Features

As a practice project in conjunction with The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp, the basic features aimed to be accomplished are:
1. Create a two-table list app where the parent table will display Categories and the child table will display the actual to-do list items
2. Allow users to add and delete entries for both tables
3. Allow users to cross-off and manually search entries in the to-do list table
4. Add random colors to a categories' row when it is first created
5. Make sure that the data in the table persists

Some additional features I added are:
1. Allow the user to edit items in both tables. They can edit the names of the entries and the color of the categories.
2. Display the date created of each to-do item
3. Add another section to the table that stores the items that have already been completed/are inactive. The user may toggle to see these items. The user may also add them back into the active items section.
4. Search functionality is now automatic while the user types
